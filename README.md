# ImageNetSplitter

### This is still work n progress!

This example is based on the pytorch example for imagenet [here](https://github.com/pytorch/examples/tree/master/imagenet)

## Requirements
- Install the requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Download the ImageNet dataset from http://www.image-net.org/.  
  If you are using the aalto triton cluster, the dataset is stored at The latest version 
  is stored at `/scratch/shareddata/dldata/imagenet/ILSVRC2012_img_train.tar` and a 
  preprocessed version is stored at `/scratch/shareddata/dldata/imagenet/imagenet21k_resized.tar.gz`
  the latter version is processed according to (this)[https://github.com/Alibaba-MIIL/ImageNet21K/blob/main/dataset_preprocessing/processing_script.sh] script.
